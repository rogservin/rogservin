# 👋 Hi, I’m Rogelio Servin — @rogservin

🌍 NYC · Toronto · Mexico City  
✈️ Independent · Global · Location-agnostic

🧠 Creative Technologist · 🧱 Blockchain Architect · 🎛️ Producer  
I design and ship **production-grade onchain systems, digital products, and creative infrastructure** at the intersection of culture, capital, and code.

## 🧭 What I do (2026)

- **Independent consulting & system architecture**
  - Token design & incentive systems
  - Smart-contract architecture (vesting, staking, royalties, access)
  - MVP → production strategy for founders and studios

- **Production smart contracts**
  - Audited, upgradeable, real-user systems
  - Ethereum & Base as primary execution layers

- **Creative & cultural IP**
  - Music, film, and media projects with a strong product layer
  - NFTs as access keys, not speculation

I focus on **systems that last**, not hype cycles.

## 🧠 How I work

- Systems > trends  
- Incentives > narratives  
- Fewer projects, higher leverage  

I don’t chase cycles.  
I help people **ship things that survive them**.
